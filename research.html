    We use a combination of field, laboratory, and bioinformatic methods to better understand ecology and evolution.
    Most of our research is focused on Appalachian amphibians, especially the lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae.

      <h2>variation in reproductive behavior &amp; morphology</h2>
      <p>
        Plethodontid salamanders engage in fascinating, ritualized courtship and have suites of morphological traits used in these behaviors.
        Males of some species of "brook salamanders" (<em>Eurycea</em>) exhibit two discrete strategies found within a single population—a phenomenon
        known as <strong>alternative reproductive tactics</strong>. We study the origin, maintenance, and consequences of this variation using
        local fieldwork, laboratory experiments, museum specimens, and genomic data.

      <h2>hybridization, phylogeography, &amp; species delimitation</h2>
      <p>
        Evolution is complicated. Sometimes speciation happens with continuous gene flow; other times, species that diverged in allopatry
        hybridize in regions of secondary contact. Appalachian salamanders provide especially compelling models for studying
        <strong>reticulate evolution</strong>, and we use genomic data to understand how changing landscapes shape genetic diversity.

      <h2>conservation of rare and imperiled species</h2>
      <p>
        Effective conservation depends on good science. We work with conservation biologists at government agencies and NGOs to provide
        data on the <strong>distribution and status</strong> of imperiled Appalachian organisms. This includes field surveys, environmental DNA,
        and population genomic approaches to estimate gene flow.
